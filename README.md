# JavaTagCloudGenerator
 
JavaTagCloudGenerator is a command-line tool that generates an HTML-based tag cloud from a given text file. The tag cloud visually represents the most frequent words in the text, where word sizes are scaled based on their frequency. This project demonstrates core Java skills such as file I/O, string processing, data structures (e.g., HashMap, ConcurrentSkipListSet), and HTML generation.

This project is from the Fall of 2023 but was moved from subversion to GitHub explaining the all in one commit
